# What's Open Source Mycetoma (MycetOS)?
MycetOS is a science project aimed at discovering new medicines for the treatment of a terrible fungal infection, eumycetoma.
The project uses open source principles, meaning that you can get involved as a full partner.

We started on February 6th 2018. [Press release](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/Talks-Meetings-Publicity/blob/master/Press%20Release/MycetOS%20news%20release_5Feb2018_FINAL.docx). [One-page description of the whole idea](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/Talks-Meetings-Publicity/blob/master/One-Page%20MycetOS%20Explainer/MycetOS%20-%20Open%20Source%20Mycetoma%20v2.pdf). [The first paper that serves as a launchpad](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/02/258905).
The first newsletter is [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/Series-1-Fenarimols/issues/43) and you can [sign up for more](https://forms.gle/hHvURWKJQTymhJ9p7).

# Where to Find Things
Everything is online. You're looking at the Github community.
There's also a [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenSourceMycetoma).
There's a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MycetOS).
A chemist, Hung Duong, worked on the project in 2017. His [lab notebook is public](http://tinyurl.com/MyOS-HungELN), as is his [thesis](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/Series-1-Fenarimols/blob/master/Theses%20Reports%20Docs/Hung%20Duong%20Hons%20Thesis/Thesis-DUONG-2017.pdf). Another Honours student, Matthew O'Dowd, also has his [lab notebook online](https://tinyurl.com/MyOS-MattELN).
The molecules related to the project are all in a [spreadsheet](http://tinyurl.com/MycetomaMols).
Background to the project will gradually be placed on the wiki (link above), but each series of molecules will have its own wiki in its own repository.

# What Can You Do?
Take a look at the [preprint of the first paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/02/258905). Head over to the [area ("repository") that deals with the first series of molecules we're looking at](https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma/Series-1-Fenarimols), and see if you can help with any of the active Issues.
Alternatively take a look at the [Reddit community](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenSourceMycetoma).
If things aren't clear, get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MycetOS) (vastly preferred, since it's public) or email (non-preferred, because private. It's opensourcemycetoma@gmail.com).

# Who is MycetOS?
Anyone can be an equal partner. It was started by Wendy van de Sande (Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam), Ben Perry (@MrBenGP) and Jean-Robert Ioset (Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, Geneva) and Matthew Todd (The University of Sydney, @mattoddchem). Contact person on Github is @mattodd.
